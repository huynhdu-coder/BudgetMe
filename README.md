## Features

### Landing Page
Our clean and intuitive landing page provides a brief overview of what BudgetMe is all about. From here, you can easily sign in or sign up to start managing your finances.

### First Time Sign-In
When you sign in for the first time, BudgetMe will ask you a few questions to understand your financial goals and preferences. This helps us tailor the app to better suit your needs.

### Dashboard
Once signed in, you'll be greeted with a comprehensive dashboard where you can input your total money and itemize your planned expenses.

### Expense Input
On the dashboard, you can input your total available money and list what you plan to spend it on. For example:
- **Total Input:** $1500
- **Bread:** $10
- **Apple:** $20

### Visualize Your Spending
BudgetMe features a dynamic chart at the bottom of the dashboard, which visualizes your spending as percentages of your total budget. For example, if you spend $10 on bread and $20 on apples from a total of $1500:
- **Bread:** (10 / 1500) * 100 = 0.67%
- **Apple:** (20 / 1500) * 100 = 1.33%

This helps you see at a glance where your money is going and adjust your spending habits accordingly.
